# LeadProof Extension + Server Starter

This archive contains a Chrome extension starter (Manifest V3) and a minimal Node.js server skeleton.

Open `extension/` to load the unpacked extension into Chrome (chrome://extensions) for testing. Edit `service/service-worker.js` to point to your real API endpoint.
